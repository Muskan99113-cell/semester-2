 # *PRACTICALS*
 # *1) Write a program to compute the sum of the first n terms of the following series:*
 # *□ =1− 1/2^2+1/3^3−1/4^4+1/5^5− . . ..The number of terms n is to be taken from the user through the command line. If the command line argument is not found then prompt the user to enter the value of n.*
